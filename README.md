## Architecture
I haven't started on the entirety of the application design. however, it will be a vertical format with the search bar and header as static, the rendering content as dynamic, and the the information listed as static. 

## Change Log
4-8-2020 5:30pm: The program is up and running on heroku however we haven't been given the extra documentation to continue. Or, I'm not finding the index or anything else in the class-06 repo.
